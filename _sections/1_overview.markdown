The popover appears as some sort of tooltip when you click on a triggering element. 
I am always trying to make my components behave as natural / native-like as possible. This popover component can be positioned 
 left/right/above/below the triggering element and it disappears the moment you interact with anything else on the page. If you try 
 to open another popover or simply click away (anywhere on the page), the popover will close. It will also close if you click its
 trigger again.
 
You can use the popover to display contextual information or even for menus...maybe a "more links" sort of menu.
